# when we refer to a dataframe using the matrix notation, the output is simplified to the lowest possible dimensionality. 
mean_func <- function(df,var_list) {
  # Extract out the selected columns as per the supplied vector of indices
  df_selected <- df[,var_list]
  # df_selected <- df[,var_list, drop=F] if we want NOT to reduce dimension, using drop = F

# 
# WAY TO SOLVE :
# 1.USING DROP = F FOR DATA FRAME
# 2.USING LIST MODE OF DATA FRAME DF[1](SINCE DATA FRAME IS ACTUALLY A LIST)

# C OOP
predict(glm_model, newdata = test_df, type="response")
#would fail if model is a rpart tree, unless you specify the type to 'prob'

# S4 Versus S3 (package ROCR)
#' Fortunately, there isnâ€™t a whole lot that you need to know about S4 objects for most of your tasks. 
#' Be aware of these minimal facts (1) Similar to the names function that you use to investigate the 
#' components of a S3 object (if they are named), in S4 you will use slotNames (2) To extract out specific 
#' components from an object rather than using the $ operator like we do for S3, you would need to use the 
#' @ operator.
